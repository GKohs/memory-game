# Memory Game

It's a tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org you can find here: https://youtu.be/lhNdUVh3qCc

1st commit is my code resulted in following the 'tutorial'.

Later commits are my own attempts to upgrade the idea.

# Done
- prevent choosing same card twice
- prevent choosing already chosen cards

# Possibilities
- replace alert with something better
- upgrade the look
- game menu?
- different size
- different amount of cards
- random card picture (http://lorempixel.com/100/100/cats/)
- 2 player game option
